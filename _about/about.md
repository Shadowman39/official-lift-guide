This lift guide first started in December 2009 as an [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/The-Official-Guide-to-Knex-Ball-Machine-Lifts/), and back then it included about ten different lift types. I ([Shadowman39](https://www.instructables.com/member/Shadowman39/)) made that guide since ball machine builders got interested in making unique lifts for their machines other than the standard chain lift, which started in 2009 due to my machine [Wipe Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Y1k7d9vPk), which featured four new lifts. Since there were already guides for ball machine elements at the time, it was a good idea to begin documenting all the lift types that people had invented. 

<br>
Over the years lifts were added by myself and some other contributors, and the last update in 2016 stopped at 81 total steps! In early 2024 I wanted to keep updating it with more new lifts, but the Instructables page with all those steps took more than 30 seconds to load every time, and I wanted a better way to organize them as well as speed up loading times. This site is the result. Another benefit is that, since the [code is on Github](https://github.com/Shadowman39/official-lift-guide), others can contribute their lifts or offer other changes to the code so I won't have to be the only one to add everything. More info on this below.


## How to Contribute

The easiest way you can add your own lift to the guide is to fill out [this submission form](https://forms.gle/W1UGYmtKUfto4boaA). Here you can submit all the required information, including images. If approved your changes will be made on the site in a later update. If you don't have a Google account for the form you can [email/contact me directly](https://shadowman39.github.io/official-lift-guide/about/contact/).

The more advanced way is to [open a pull request](https://github.com/Shadowman39/official-lift-guide/pulls) on the Github page. Here you can not only add lifts but make changes to the website's code and functionality.
