These involve a chain, either the normal chain pieces or one that's made from normal connectors, that goes around gears and tensioned with a set of idler gears. Attached to the chain are ball claws to pick them up. The balls can leave either with a small pusher above the claw or pushed around the top gears until they fall out. 

> ##### TIP
>
> A motor can turn the gears at the top, bottom, or middle, but it operates smoother with the motor at the top.
