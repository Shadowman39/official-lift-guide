These lifts use elevator carts to lift one or multiple balls up a shaft, with the use of pulleys or cranks. If using pulleys with chain or string, there needs to be some mechanism to make it go in two directions, reversing when the cart gets to the top and bottom. This was first done with my forward/reverse transmission (instructions of just the transmission can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/Knex-ForwardReverse-Transmission/)), but there are other ways as can be seen below. The most reliable and balanced methods are the transmission and reversing chain. The lifts below are mainly categorized by their directional methods, with the concepts of the shaft (whether vertical or curved) and cart being similar on all of them.
