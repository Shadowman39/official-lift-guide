These lifts involve a wheel or set of arms that rotates a continuous 360 degrees. Even though some may look more like an arm lift, isn't a wheel lift just a bunch of arms put together? The wheels can get pretty large, but keep in mind that powering the wheels from the center axis will cause unsmooth movement.
